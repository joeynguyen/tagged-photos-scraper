# How to install this app on MacOS

On the [release page](https://github.com/joeynguyen/tagged-photos-scraper/releases), for the newest version available, download the file with the filename that ends with either **.dmg** or **.-mac.zip**.

- With the **.dmg** file, open it and it will give you the option of moving the application to your Applications folder.
- With the **.-mac.zip** file, double-click it to unzip the file which should give you the application file itself; move that file to your Applications folder.

Double-click the Tagged Photos Scraper application in your Applications folder to begin running it.

For some of you, the app may run fine right away. If so, proceed to using it. However, some of you will see the warning in the screenshot below about the app "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" when you first try to run it.

This is because I am not registered with Apple as part of their [developer program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/). This is the first MacOS app that I've ever built, and I don't plan to release it in the Mac App Store so I don't want to pay the fees to register with Apple.

To bypass Apple's restriction, open your System Preferences application, click on the Security & Privacy selection, and there will be an "Open Anyway" button you can click.

You'll probably get one more warning prompt from Apple like the one below. Click the "Open" button and you'll finally be able to use the app.
